Back to the days when I was still a dreamy sheep, I used to set up so many goals in life. For example, one day I would try to solve a Leetcode problem, the other day I would try to build a blog, etc. But as time passed hardly did I do complete all of those tasks. \
After a long time struggling with the problem, I finally found out the reason why I couldn’t keep up with the tasks I set like how other people do, which is short and simple: I was confused between goals and wishes.

# Wishes

Two years ago I used to dream of becoming a Fullstack Developer within the next 3 years. One Monday I just turned out to have such thoughts and right after that I immediately opened my computer and started to explore every document on the topic “How to become a Fullstack Developer”, then I realised it requires so much effort to learn such a thing, which was too difficult for me at that time. I gave up and thought I might think about it later. \
The next day, my process refreshed and my head felt like a blank paper without a single information about the topic before. I fell into the “fastfood” trap and that big goal went into the abyss. Six months later, I saw a young man, only 2 year younger than me, actually managed to build a selling website using NodeJS and ReactJS. The jealousy I got made me want to study right then. The cycle continued to turn. \
From my own story, you can obviously see that wishes are only random thoughts across your mind. They appear to be unclear, without details, and include no force for you to turn them into actual actions. For example, you want to have 6 packs, but you are too lazy to go to the gym. Even though registering a 1-month ticket, you only show up at the gym like 3 times. That’s called a wish, not a goal.

# Goals

Goals are more clearly, detailed, measurable, and they have prices to pay. For instance, instead of writing into your note “I want to have 6 packs”, try “I will do 50 push-ups and 5 rounds of 20 sit-ups everyday, and if getting a chance I will go to the gym”. \
As you can see, the first sentence is simply your wish, but the second one is truly a goal. \
The second shows you which things you need to do the next day, also the cost you have to pay to obtain 6 packs. The first sentence only gives you the top of the mountain, but the second one shows you the journey you have to take to achieve your goal (how long the distance is, what tools you must bring along and what risks you need to take when climbing that mountain). \
If you just moved to Ha Noi for the first time, obviously you would not be able to drive to Cau Giay from Hoang Mai on your own; therefore, you would need some assistance from Google Maps to find the easiest way to finish the journey, right? \
Imagine you were at Hoang Mai, and your goal were Cau Giay, then how would you go? How could you draw your own way?

# To achieve your goals, you must pay for them.

Maybe you can only do 5 push-ups a day, but if it happens every day, you can create a hige difference compared to when you so such a thing a few times a year, 5 push-ups each. If you are willing to face the cost and keep it on a steady ride, sooner or later you will achive the goal you set.

# Focus on your road to the goals, don’t merely look at the top of mountain.

When you only care about your destinations, you might be immensely stressed. That is because you don’t know how long it takes to arrive there. When looking only at the top, you will feel more painful to keep up with the journey and come to the conclusion that you yourself can not make it. \
The majority of us sorely pay attention to the top, which leads to our wrong estimations. \
No one cares about how hard you’ve tried to reach your place, they only care about the result – what you’ve actually achieved. Only you understand how struggling you have been to be there. So please keep focusing on your path to the goals, strive your best, pay for it, and enjoy the toilsome journeyahead.
